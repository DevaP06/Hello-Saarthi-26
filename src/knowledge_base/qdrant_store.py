"""Qdrant collection management: creation, idempotent upsert, and the
point-ID scheme. Lazy-imports qdrant_client so nothing that only
chunks/embeds needs it installed.

Idempotency: Qdrant point IDs must be a UUID or unsigned int, not an
arbitrary string — chunk_id (a "chunk_<hex>" string) is deterministically
mapped to a UUID5 so the SAME chunk_id always produces the SAME point ID
across runs/machines (stable, not random), satisfying "use deterministic
point IDs based on stable chunk IDs" without fighting Qdrant's ID type
restriction. content_hash is stored in the payload specifically so a
re-run can skip re-upserting a point whose content hasn't changed
("unchanged chunks should not be needlessly re-embedded or re-uploaded").
